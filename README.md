# Jukebox
Jukebox is an app where users can add their favorite songs for others to discover.
There will be a maximum number of 32 songs that can be added.
When user selects genre the artists of that genre will populate the grid and a button will appear to add artist.

When a user adds a new artist they must provide album name, at least one song, and choose one of the three genres (required) and may optionally enter description for the artist, year of the album release, a link to a video of other location where the song may be heard.

When user clicks on artist name in grid they will go to artist’s page which will have some description of the artist, a list of albums, a link to artist’s website and will have a button to edit the artist (add new album with at least one song) and another button to delete.
When user clicks an album it will open the song list page and there will be a button to edit the song description, lyrics, link to the song’s video.
